    ## About AllianceDAO

The AllianceDAO NFT is an NFT project launched to reward participants of the Game of Alliance (GOA). The GoA was an incentivized testnet designed to battle-test Terra’s Alliance module before its mainnet launch, and it ran from February 9th to March 2nd, 2023. During the game, users could stake on different Alliance chains and move their tokens around to optimize rewards as the parameters of each chain changed. Player’s final scores were calculated based on the total staking rewards they earned plus the points they earned from completing different missions. For more information on the Alliance module and how it works, visit the **[Alliance website](https://alliance.terra.money/)**.  

## Mission

On January 17th, 2024, AllianceDAO passed a [governance proposal](https://dao.enterprise.money/dao/proposal?address=terra1g0mfrpswewteaf9ky4rlj09wh5njp6u9xxk94uszplw4qz2f9mzq3k27fm&id=10) which formalized its mission: "To promote the successful adoption and evolution of the Alliance module across Cosmos."

    ## How Rewards Work

The same smart contract that minted the AllianceDAO NFTs also minted an asset called “Ally.” This asset is solely owned by the NFT contract, and will never be transferred to anyone outside of the contract. On February 23, 2023, the Terra commuity passed a [governance proposal](https://station.terra.money/proposal/phoenix-1/4801) to add “Ally" as an Alliance asset, enabling the token to earn a portion of LUNA staking rewards. The current Reward Weight for “Ally” is .008 — or around .72% of total LUNA staking rewards. "Ally" currently has no Take Rate. Upon the proposal’s passing, the AllianceDAO voted to stake the Ally toke to start earning LUNA rewards. The delegation of the asset is controlled by AllianceDAO governance and can be changed at any time. Staking rewards will be collected periodically using Warp Protocol and stored in the AllianceDAO contract.

After the contract collects the staking rewards, each NFT will accrue rewards at an equal rate. At any point, NFT holders can connect their Station wallet to the AllianceDAO NFT website and “break” their NFT to claim their LUNA rewards. Importantly, NFT rewards can only be claimed once per NFT. Once an NFT has been broken, no more Alliance staking rewards will accrue to it. Although broken NFTs no longer accrue Alliance staking rewards, they can still be staked to the DAO on Enterprise to participate in governance.

Each “unbroken” NFT will receive an equal proportion of the ever-growing Alliance reward pool. As users break their NFTs to claim rewards, the amount of outstanding, unbroken NFTs gets smaller, and their share of the reward pool gets larger.

For example, if you own one of 10,000 “unbroken” NFTs, your NFT represents 1/10,000 of the pool. If 6,000 people break their NFTs, the number of unbroken NFTs will shrink, and your claim on the pool becomes 1/4,000 of the pool. The longer you hold your NFT without breaking it, the greater your reward will be.

AllianceDAO NFTs are transferable, which means that if you send an unbroken NFT to someone, the wallet in possession of the NFT will be the only user that can claim the LUNA rewards.

    ## How To Claim Rewards

NFT rewards can only be claimed once per NFT. Once an NFT has been broken, no more Alliance staking rewards will accrue to it. Although broken NFTs no longer accrue Alliance staking rewards, they can still be staked to the DAO on Enterprise to participate in governance. 

1. To claim your rewards and break your NFT, connect the wallet that contains your NFT and visit the [Gallery](http://dao.alliance.money/nft-gallery) page. 
2. Click **My NFTs**. 
3. Once on your NFT page, click the **Claim Rewards** button.
4. Sign the transaction in your Station extension by inputting your password. The Luna stored in your NFT will be sent to your wallet, and your NFT will be broken. Broken NFTs no longer accure rewards.
